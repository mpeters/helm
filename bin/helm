=head1 NAME

helm - Easy server and cluster automation

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    helm TASK [OPTIONS]

    # patch the same file on all of the machines in your cluster 
    helm patch --file my_fix.patch --target /opt/cool_system/do_stuff.pl

    # run a command on only the servers which run memcache
    helm run --command "pidof memcached" --roles memcache 

    # copy a file to every server in your cluster
    helm put --local foo.tar.gz --remote /tmp/bar.tar.gz

    # rsync a local folder to specific servers
    helm rsync_put --local lib/important --remote /tmp/important_libs --servers web1,web2,web4

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<helm> is command-line utility to make it easy to automate system tasks
for individual machines, a cluster of machines or a subset of machines
in a cluster. It has the following features:

=over

=item *

Combine multiple commands into a single tasks and to have groups of
related tasks gathered together.

=item *

Uses SSH as the transport layer for tasks and uses SSH keys for automatic
authorization.

=item *

Simple optional configuration file describing your cluster, allowing
tasks to target a single machine, multiple machines which share the
same role, or all machines in your cluster. Can also be extended to pull
configuration from more complicated sources like LDAP, etc.

=item *

Logging of each action performed to multiple channels: console, log file,
irc, email, etc.

=item *

Interact with the remote processes via C<STDIN>, C<STDOUT> and C<STDERR>.

=item *

Convenient F<.helmrc> file to reduce the number of options you need to
pass on every invocation of C<helm>.

=item *

Locking on the client and/or server so that multiple invocations
of C<helm> aren't running at the same time.

=head1 OPTIONS

C<helm> has several options that can be specified for all commands. Any
remaining arguments are passed to the task that was invoked. These global
options are:

=over

=item --servers

Specifically list out the hostnames of the servers to send the task
to. These can either be full hostnames (or an unambiguous abbreviation
of your servers as defined in your L<CONFIGURATION>). Multiple hostnames
must me specified in a comma separated list.

If no servers (or roles) are specified, then the task will be performed
on all servers (as defined in your L<CONFIGURATION>).

    # using full hostnames 
    --servers 192.168.0.23,192.168.0.24,web1.company.com

    # using abbreviations from config file 
    --servers web1,web2,web3

=item --roles

Instead of specifying the servers explicitly, you can instead
specify which server roles you want to target (as defined in your
L<CONFIGURATION>). Multiple roles must be specified in a comma separated
list.

If no roles (or servers) are specified, then the task will be performed
on all servers (as defined in your L<CONFIGURATION>).

    # single role 
    --roles web

    # multiple roles
    --roles web,cache

=item --config

Which resource to use for pulling cluster configuration information (see
L<CONFIGURATION>).

    --config helm:///etc/helm.conf

=item --log-level

The log level used. Can be one of C<debug>, C<info>, C<warn>,
and C<error>.  Defaults to C<info>.

=item --log

Log messages to a specific channel. Multiple channels can be
specified by specifying this option multiple times. The value of this
option is the URI of the channel to be used.  See L<LOG CHANNELS>
for more details.

    # send log messages to a comany tech IRC channel 
    --log irc://helm@irc.company.com/tech

    # log messages to a file and to email address
    --log file:///var/log/helm.log --log mailto:helm@company.com?from=helm@company.com

Log messages are also sent to C<STDERR> unless the L<--quiet> option
is also passed.

=item --load

Allows you to load other 3rd party plugin modules to extend C<helm>
functionality. This could be to add more log channels, different
configuration loading, etc. The value of this option is the full Perl
module name of the plugin. This can be specified multiple times.

    # load a hypothetical Yammer log plugin 
    --load Helm::Log::Channel::Yammer

    # load hypothetical custom LDAP configuration and
    --load Helm::Conf::Loader::CompanyLDAP

See L<WRITING HELM PLUGINS> for more information.

=item --sudo

The user that should be used to perform the commands on the remote server.
The actual SSH connection will be made using the current user's SSH keys,
but then once the connection is made to the remote server, it's sometimes
useful for the commands to be run as a different user. We also try to make
sure that things like file permissions (on tasks like C<put> and C<patch>)
are also handled so that the resulting files are owned by this sudo user.

=item --lock

This options allows you to have control over whether concurrent C<helm> processes
can be running on either the local or remote servers. The value can be one of: C<none>,
C<local>, C<remote>, C<both>.

=item --no-rc-file

Suppress the default loading of the L<".helmrc file"|THE .helmrc FILE>
file.

=item --port

The port to use for SSH on all of the remote servers. Defaults to the standard (22).

=item --timeout

The timeout in seconds to give the ssh connections. Default is 30 seconds.

=item --quiet

Suppress the default logging to C<STDERR>

=item --help

Display the synopsis

=item --man

Display this documentation

=item --version

Display the version of Helm installed

=item --dump-config

Display a dump of the configuration data as understood by Helm

=back

=cut

=head1 TASKS

=head1 CONFIGURATION

By default, C<helm> doesn't use a configuration file, but certain features
require it (using roles, server abbreviations, etc) so it's best to
have one. You can tell C<helm> which configuration resource to use by using
the L<--config> option. Currently, only the C<helm://> URI scheme
is supported.  

    --config helm:///etc/helm.conf

A configuration file will look something like this:

    <Server web[1-5].company.com>
        Role web
    </Server>

    <Server db1.company.com>
        Role db Role db_master
    </Server>

    <Server db2.company.com>
        Role db Role db_slave
    </Server>

This configuration would define 7 servers (web1.company.com,
web2.company.com, web3.company.com, web4.company.com, web5.company.com,
db1.company.com and db2.company.com). It defines 4 different roles (web,
db, db_master, db_slave).

C<helm> currently just supports a single configuration resource format
(C<helm://>), but the internals are flexible enough that more formats
could be supported in the future, including other configuration methods
like LDAP, etc.

If, for instance you wanted to support a URI like:

    --config ldap://ldap.company.com

See L<WRITING HELM PLUGINS> for more information.

If you are having problems getting your configuration right, you can pass
the L<--dump-config> option to tell C<helm> to display what it thinks things
are configured to be.

=head1 LOG CHANNELS

C<helm> can be told to send various levels of log data to different
channels. By default we support a log file, IRC and email logs. We also
support various log levels (see the L<--log-level> option).

You can specify which channel is used by giving a URI which indicates
what type of channel and where to send the log. The following URI schemes
are supported:

=over

=item file://

This is basically a log file where messages are immediately appended.

    --log file:///var/log/helm.log

=item irc://

This is an IRC channel where messages are immediately sent. For example
to send messages to the C<sysadmin> IRC channel on C<irc.company.com>
using the user C<michael> and the password C<s3cr3t> you would have:

    --log irc://michael@irc.company.com/sysadmin?pass=s3cr3t

=item mailto:

Similar to Mail-To links in HTML documents, this just specifies an
email address to log. Log messages aren't sent immediately, but
are instead queued up to be sent once the command has been completed.

    --log mailto:michael@company.com?from=helm@company.com

=back

Plugins can be written to load allow other log channels. See L<WRITING
HELM PLUGINS> for more information on how this is done.

=head1 THE .helmrc FILE

The F<.helmrc> file contains command-line options that are prepended
to the command line before processing. Multiple options may live on
multiple lines. Lines beginning with a # are ignored. A F<.helmrc>
might look like this:

    # always log to a file 
    --log file:///var/log/helm.log

    # always load our custom plugins 
    --load Helm::Conf::Loader::CompanyLDAP 
    --load Helm::Log::CompanyYammer
    --load Company::CustomHelmTasks

C<helm> looks in your home directory or the current directory for
the F<.helmrc>. You can specify another location with the C<HELMRC>
environment variable.

If L<--no-rc-file> is specified on the command line, the F<.helmrc> file
is ignored.

=head1 WRITING HELM PLUGINS

Helm can be extended in many ways to make it more convenient for your projects.
Helm has 3 customization points where plugins can be written and registered to
interact: C<task>, C<log> and C<configuration>. Using the C<--load> option, you
can tell Helm about your custom or 3rd party Perl modules that you would like to
load. Each plugin module must register itself with Helm along with the type of events
it will handle using the C<< Helm->register_module >> method. For example, if I were
creating a new plugin module for a custom task named "spiffy" I might invoke
Helm like:

    helm spiffy --load MyCompany::Helm::Task::spiffy

And my Perl module might look something like this:

    package MyCompany::Helm::Task::spiffy;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Helm;
    use Moose;
    extends 'Helm::Task';
    Helm->register_module('task', spiffy => 'MyCompany::Helm::Task::spiffy')

    sub validate {
        my $self = shift;
        # custom validation
    }

    sub execute {
        my ($self, %args) = @_;
        # do something spiffy
    }

    1;

Most likely you'd put the C<--load> statment in your F<.helmrc> file
so you wouldn't have to worry about it again.  Now we'll get into the
details of what is expected of each type of plugin.

=head2 Task Plugins

A task plugin should inherit from L<Helm::Task> and implement the following methods:

=over

=item validate

This method would perform any custom validation needed before the task
is executed against any servers. Normally this involves validating the
custom options this task might use. This method only receives a single
object, the task itself.  As an example, lets say you want a C<--nifty>
option to your C<spiffy> plugin above:

    helm spiffy --nifty foo

Then your validation method might look something like this:

    sub validate {
        my $self          = shift;
        my $helm          = $self->helm;
        my $extra_options = $helm->extra_options;
        my $nifty         = $extra_options->{nifty};
        $helm->die("You need to provide a --nifty option!") unless $nifty;
        $helm->die("--nifty option ($nifty) is not a valid value") unless $nifty =~ /^fo+/;
    }

=item execute

This is the meat of your task plugin and is where the work happens. This method is called
once for every server the task is being executed against. It receives the following named arguments:

=over

=item ssh

A L<Net::OpenSSH> object with an already open SSH connection to the server in question.

=item server

A L<Helm::Server> object for the currently executing task.

=back

As long as your method doesn't die (or preferrably calls C<< $helm->die() >>, then we will assume
that all was fine and dandy in the execution of the task.

=back

=head2 Log Plugins

Log plugins can offer new channels for logging Helm output based on the URI given
to Helm. For instance, if you wanted to send SMS logging of critical messages only, you might
invoke helm with a logger like:

    helm foo --log sms:+15105550101 --load MyCompany::Helm::Log::SMS

And then your SMS module might look something like

    package MyCompany::Helm::Log::SMS;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Helm;
    use Moose;
    extends 'Helm::Log::Channel';
    Helm->register_module('log', sms => 'MyCompany::Helm::Log::SMS');

    sub initialize   {}
    sub finalize     {}
    sub start_server {}
    sub end_server   {}
    sub debug        {}
    sub info         {}
    sub warn         {}
    sub error        { 
        my ($self, $msg) = @_;
        # send SMS message
    }
    1;

In this example, we don't care about anything except errors (since SMS messages cost money
and would get really annoying for anything with frequency). Log plugins need to inherit
from L<Helm::Log::Channel> and implement the following methods:

=over

=item intialize

=item finalize

=item start_server

=item end_server

=item debug

=item info

=item warn

=item error

=back

=head3 Configuration Plugins

Configuration plugins can implement new ways to load configuration data
about your servers based on the URI given to helm. For instance, if you
wanted to load the list of your servers and their roles from a company
LDAP server, you might invoke Helm like:

    helm foo --config ldap://ldap.company.com --load MyCompany::Helm::Conf::ldap

Helm will look for the last module registered to handle the C<ldap> scheme
of that url. That module might look like:

    package MyCompany::Helm::Conf::ldap;
    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Helm;
    use Moose;
    extends 'Helm::Conf::Loader';
    Helm->register_module('configuration', ldap => 'MyCompany::Helm::Conf::ldap')

    sub load {
        my ($self, %args) = @_;
        my $uri = $args{uri};
        # poke around in our LDAP server and create a list of Helm::Server objects
        my @servers = ...;
        # then return a Helm::Conf object
        return Helm::Conf->new(servers => \@servers)
    }

    1;

A configuration loading plugin should inherit from L<Helm::Conf::Loader>
and implement the following methods:

=over

=item load

This method is the backbone of a configuration plugin. It receives the
following named arguments:

=over

=item uri

A L<URI> object representing the URI passed on the command line to be
loaded by this configuration loader.

=item helm

The C<Helm> object doing the loading.

=back

This method must create a list of L<Helm::Server> objects and use them
to return a L<Helm::Conf> object.

=back

=head1 CAVEATS

=over 

=item Multi-Platform

This has been developed and tested on Linux (with bash as the shell
on the remote hosts) only. Dealing with multiple platforms and writing
multi-platform tasks has been punted to the future.

=item Alpha Software

This software is very ALPHA, which means it's interface is likely to
change in the future.  It's used currently and happily in production
but please be aware if you start using it that you'll probably want to
follow future versions carefully to make sure you aren't bitten by API
changes as thing are flushed out.

=back

=head1 TODO

In the not too distant future, we'd like to add the following features
to Helm:

=over

=item * Help command and help docs for each task

=item * A way to set/read the remote environment variables for the user logging in via SSH.

=item * Add an option to run tasks in parallel on different servers

=item * Add a capture option which allows stdout/stderr to be handled differently

=item * Add a compare option which allows the output (stdout/stderr) to be compared between servers in an intelligent manner
